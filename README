====================================================================

GENERAL NOTES
-------------

This is a virtual keyboard for AWE, MIDI and ALSA drivers.
It's a simple fake of a MIDI keyboard on X-windows system.
Enjoy a music with your mouse and "computer" keyboard :-)

The program requires Tcl7.5/Tk4.1 or newer libraries.
This program supports:
  - ALSA sequencer (ver.0.5.2)
  - AWE driver on OSS  (ver.0.4.3)
  - MIDI device on OSS and ALSA
Since the most of the part is written by Tcl/Tk script, it'll be not
so difficult to apply this program to other systems.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Edit Makefile

You may need to modify Makefile for your system.
The following values can be configurable:

  - PREFIX
      Destination directory prefix (e.g. /usr/local)
  - INSTALL_DIR
      Destination directory where the program will be installed.
  - VKLIB_DIR
      Directory where vkeybd Tcl file, key list and preset list files
      are stored.
  - MAN_DIR
      Man page prefix directory (e.g. /usr/local/man)
  - MAN_SUFFIX
      Man page prefix

  - USE_ALSA
  - USE_AWE
  - USE_MIDI
      Device selection.  Multiple devices are available.
      To disable a device, set the value 0.  Do not undefine it.
      At least one of them must have non-zero value.

  - TCLLIB
      Tcl library for linking, given as "-lxxx"
  - TCLINC
      Tcl include path option for cc, given as "-Ixxx"
  - TKLIB, XLIB
      Tk and X libraries (-lxxx)
  - TKINC, XINC
      Tk and X include path option (-Ixxx)
  - EXTRALIB
      Other required library (-lxxx)
      
2. Run make.

3. Install via "make install".


USAGE
-----

Load the soundfont via sfxload utility before using this program.
Then, just start vkeybd.  The following command line options are
accpted.

Common Options:
  --device mode
	Use the specified mode for output device.
	The argument are "awe", "midi" or "alsa", for AWE/OSS,
	MIDI/OSS and ALSA devices, respectively.
	Default is alsa.
  --config file
	Use the specified file as config file (see below)
  --preset file
	Use the specified file as preset list file (see below)
  --channel num
	Specify the channel to be played for normal instruments.
	Valid only for MIDI and ALSA devices. Default is 0.
  --drum num
	Specify the channel to be played for drum instruments.
	Valid only for MIDI and ALSA devices. Default is 9.

ALSA Device Option:
  --addr client:port or 's'
	Set ALSA client and port numbers to be connected.
	If argument begins with 's', the port is opened as subscription
	port, and events are sent to all subscribers.  Otherwise,
	vkeybd connects directly to the specified port.
	Default is 's'.

OSS Sequencer Device Option:
  --seqdev file
	Specify the device file path for sequencer access.
	As default /dev/sequencer is used.
  --seqidx num
	Specify the synth device index for AWE32/64 WaveTable.
	If negative value is given, the device is auto-probed.
	Default value is -1.

MIDI Device Option:
  --mididev file
	Speicfy the file path of MIDI device.
	Default value is /dev/midi.


FILE MENU
---------

"Connection" shows whether the vkeybd connects to the device.
On OSS system, only one application is allowed to access sequencer
device.  Thus, if one wants to play another program even using another
device, he needs to disconnect vkeybd once.  On ALSA or OSS emulation
on ALSA, you don't have to switch vkeybd off, since multiple access is
allowed.

With "Save Config", the current keymap and view configuration are
saved on ~/.vkeybdrc config file.  This file will be read at the next
invoke.

VIEW MENU
---------

Thie menu shows the check buttons to toggle the display of control
buttons.

With "Key/Velocity" button, a key and a velocity scale bars are
shown.  The key scale indicates the lowest note value of the visible
keyboard (as default 48 = C4).  The velocity scale bar is used to
change the velocity of each note-on.

With "Control" button, controls for the current channel and for the
MIDI continous-controls are enabled.  The channel number is increased
or decreased by clicking the right or left button around the shown
channel number.  The bank and preset are remembered for each channel.
You may choose the CC to be adjusted by pull-down menu, which
indicates "ModWheel" as default.  Then change the parameter value with 
the scale bar at the right side.

With "Pitch" button, you may adjust pitch wheel.  The pitch goes
back to the center position when you click the "Pitch Clear" button
at the left.

With "Program" button, the selection list of playing instrument is
toggled.  The shown presets are read from preset list file.

KEYBOARD
--------

Each visible key is mapped on your computer keyboard from 'z' to '\'.
To use the computer keyboard, you should turn off auto repeat on your
X display via "xset -r".

The key assignment can be changed by editting the config file
~/.vkeybdrc.  Once save the current configuration via File/Save Config
menu.  The config file is the Tcl source, and you may change the list
of keymap as you wish.

The keymap is a list of elements consisting on the key symbol and the
corresponding note offset.  The key symbol is the X key symbol for
assigned key, and note offset is the shifted note number from note key
of beginning of keyboard, which is changed by "Key" scalebar.
For example, when a pair of {a 8} is defined and the lowest MIDI key
is 48, a MIDI note 56 will be turned on by pressing the key 'a'.


PRESET LIST FILE
----------------

The preset list file is used to describe the list of MIDI preset
names.  If the command line option is omitted, the default preset list
file "~/vkeybd.list", "~/.vkeybd.list" and "$vkblib/vkeybd.list" are
searched sequentially.  The preset list will appear when "Program"
toggle button is on, and you can select your favorite sound from the
list.

The preset list file can be converted from soundfont file via sftovkb
utility included in this package.  For example,
	% sftovkb /usr/local/lib/sfbank/synthgm.sbk > vkeybd.list
The only command line argument is the soundfont file name.  This must
be a full path name.
